/**
 * <p>
 * A ticket is a unique timestamped token. Tickets are initially created by
 * {@link TicketMachine} instances. They are designed to be serialized into
 * compact ASCII strings via their {@link #toString()} method from which they
 * may be reconstructed by a {@link TicketFactory}.
 * <p>
 * In addition to a timestamp (of configurable granularity), a ticket can store
 * application specific data which records information about the origin of the
 * ticket (for example, which node generated the ticket in a distributed system)
 * and ticket specific data (for example, the id of an associated session or
 * transaction).
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are safe for concurrent access by multiple threads.
